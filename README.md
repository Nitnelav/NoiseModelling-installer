To use :

- Install Autoit (https://www.autoitscript.com/site/)
- Install InnoSetup (https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
- Download and extract the jre1.8.0_281 tar.gz file
- Download and extract the NoiseModelling zip (https://github.com/Ifsttar/NoiseModelling/releases/download/v3.3.2/NoiseModelling_3.3.2.zip)


1. Compile the au3 using Autoit. You should get a NoiseModelling.exe file
3. Compile the installer.iss file using InnoSetup. You should get the NoiseModelling_3.3.2_install.exe

If you change the jre version or the NoiseModelling version, you'll need to edit the au3 script and the iss script accordingly.
